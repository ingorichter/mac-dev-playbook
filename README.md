# Manual Install
I still need to install this [software](https://scansnap.fujitsu.com/global/dl/setup/m-inst2-v7.html) manually due the st***p way they decided to make it available to download. It's important to download that small installer. Every other version of the ScanSnap Software is not working with my Scanner S1500M.
